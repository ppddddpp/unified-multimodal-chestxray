# Unified Multimodal Framework for Chest X-Ray Retrieval and Disease Prediction

This repository contains the official implementation of **"A unified multimodal framework for chest X-ray retrieval and disease prediction for clinical decision support."**  
It was developed as part of the HCMUS final project and integrates multimodal learning, retrieval, and explainability for medical imaging.
Published at Computers in Biology and Medicine

## Overview

### Features

* Disease-aware joint embeddings from image and text (DICOM + report)
* Knowledge-graph integration for semantic consistency and reranking
* Multimodal disease prediction and retrieval
* Attention-based and Integrated Gradient (IG) explanations
* Flask web interface for interactive demo and debugging

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.1.tar.gz
```

### 2. Data Preparation

* Place XML reports under `data/openi/xml/`
* Place DICOMs under `data/openi/dicom/`
* Overview of data folder structure can be found at dataFolderStructure.txt

### 3. Labeling and Splitting

```bash
python src/data_run.py
```

Generates `outputs/openi_labels_final.csv`.  
Split datasets are stored in `splited_data/`.

## 4. Train Knowledge Graph and Model

```bash
python src/Trainner/train.py
```

Trained CompGCN/TransE embeddings saved in `knowledge_graph/` and trained model saved in `checkpoints/`


### 5. Retrieval Evaluation

```bash
python src/Helpers/contructGT.py
```

Generates `ground_truths/test_relevance.json`. Then run evaluate in `src/Evaluate/`
Metrics include:
* Precision@K, Recall@K, nDCG, mAP  
* Per-class AUROC/F1 table  
* Statistical significance testing for ablation gains  

### 6. Web Demo

```bash
python src/web/app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to explore the interface.

## Dependencies

* PyTorch
* HuggingFace Transformers
* TimM (Swin Transformer)
* SciSpaCy (`en_core_sci_sm`)
* Flask
* Captum (for explainability)
* scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, networkx, rdflib
* Additional can be found in requirement.txt
---

## Evaluation

Retrieval relevance is based on label overlap and ontology-aware relationships.  
Evaluation reports include:
* Per-class metrics table (AUROC, F1)
* Confusion and calibration plots
* Statistical significance for ablation gains (paired t-test)
